# Resume_Where_You_Pause

This is an android app which can be installed in sdk version greater than 28.

Functionality
The problem we were trying to address with Resume is “How to make sharing work between mobile devices easier without disturbing the continuity and flow?” Therefore accordingly the end product is an application that allows the user to share work (ie. youtube videos, pdfs, websites) among mobile devices, and start from where they left off, on a new device.


Configuration
The mobile devices that are using the app need to have wifi connectivity. To share a file/link from one device to another, both devices need to be connected to the same wifi network. The connection between devices is established by scanning a QR code. 


Implemented Features

In the project , we set out three main deliverables. That was to hand-off,
A Youtube Video
A pdf file
A website (link)
We were able to implement all three of these delivarables.
